Cascading Style Sheets:
- Selectors let you identy or select HTML elements (IDs, Class, Type)

Specificity in CSS: 
- The way browser puts different attributes before another. 
    1. Type selectors (i.e. h1 and pseudo-elements ::before)
    2. Class selectors (i.e. .example, attribute selectors such as type="radio" and pseudo-classes like :hover)
    3. ID selectors (i.e. #example)
- !important will overrule the heirachy. This should be used carefully because you can solve an immediate issue but will create one down the line.

Using the Box Model: 
- When debugging in the browser, you will see the box-method using dev tools. This will display the box layout for a certain class incl size, padding, border & margin. 
- If you have two boxes that you want to me the same but with a small difference, you can add a style in-line if you wanted, such as <div class="box" style="border:2px solid red>.

CSS Display Property: 
- display: inline; no width and height as it it just occupies the space it takes up with its text content
- display: inline-block; like inline except you can add width and height
- display: block; takes up the entire line no matter what
- display: none; nothing is displayed, takes up no width/height from the DOM

Z-Index Display & Positioning:
- Elements may overlap for a number of reasons; for instance, elements positioned absolutely, or elements with negative values set for their margin property. 
  In these instances we need a way to determine which element should be displayed on top. Without explicitly using z-index the last element written to the 
  DOM (the last element you wrote in your code) will appear on top of all the others, and so on up the chain of your elements.
- To order, you give values. I.e. 3 overlapping boxes may have z-index: 1; z-index: 2; and z-index: 3; respectively. They will display in this order. 

Absolute vs Relative units:
- Absolute (px, in, mm, cm)
- Relative (%, em, vw - viewpoint width, vh - viewpoint height)
    - viewpoint would be based on the browsers rendering space. Each unit is 1/100th of width.
