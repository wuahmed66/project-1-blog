@media(min-width:800px) {
    .container {
        border: 2px solid blue;
    }
}

- This syntax would change the border to blue for the .container class when the brwoser is at least 800px wide on the device. 
- You should use this syntax for a variety of common sizes, you can use the following as a guideline: 

/* Anything smaller than first breakpoint 600px */
.container {
  // rules for small screen
}

/* Medium Screens */
@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width:900px) {
  .container {
    // rules for medium-sized screen
  }
}

/* Large Screens */
@media (min-width:901px) {
  .container {
    // rules for large screen
  }
}
