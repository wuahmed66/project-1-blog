Hypertext Markup Language:  
- Hypertext implies that it uses the http portion of the internet markup meaning the code I write is annotated with keywords. This allows the browser to read this and display visual for the user. 
    - HTML = Skeleton(foundation)
    - CSS = Skin(style)
    - Javascript = Brain(functionality/behaviour)
- Block Elements: 
    - <p>, <ul> followed by <li> which is with bullet points, <ol> followed by <li> which is with numbers, <h1> to <h6>, <articles>, <section>, <blockquote>
    - Inline elements are meant to differentiate part of a text to give it a particular function or meaning. 
        - links <a>, <em> emphasized words, <strong> important words.
- Metadata: 
    - Information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page. 
- Title: 
    - This tag is always in the <head> tag which will display on the tab of your browser and in search engines. 

Debugging HTML: 
- One of the best ways to learn how to code. 
    -  

The DOM - Document Object Model: 
- A tree which has different nodes that come off it. Each of these nodes are the tags (Paragraph, link etc), at the end of these nodes are objects. 
- DOM methods allow programatic access to the tree, then you can change the style, structure or content. 
- The DOM starts as a single parent item that branches out into child items heirarchically. 
- The DOM reads all objects in the order they're written (html > head > body > footer)

Typical Webpage: 
- <header> first element of the page which can include logo/tagline. 
- <nav> nav bar.
- <h1> title of the page
- <article> as the main content of the page. 
- <footer> last element on the page.
