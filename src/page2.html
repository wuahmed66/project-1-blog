            <h5>Origin Story</h5>
            CSS was first proposed by Hakon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, 
            Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee (father of Html) at CERN. The European Organization 
            for Nuclear Research is known as CERN. Hakon wium lie is know as father of css. 
            CSS was proposed in 1994 as a web styling language, to solve some of the problems of Html 4. 
            There were other styling languages proposed at this time, such as Style Sheets for Html and JSSS but CSS won.    
          
            <h5>Vannevar Bush</h5>
            CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998. CSS 2 includes 
            a number of new capabilities like below;
            <ul><li>absolute/relative</li>
                <li> fixed</li>
                <li> positioning</li>
                 <li> z-index</li>
                 <li>concept of media type</li>
                 <li> bidirectional text</li>
                <li>new font properties such as shadows.</li>     </ul><p></p>

            <h5>The Ongoing Journey</h5>
            CSS3 was started in 1998 but it has never been completed. Some parts are still being developed and some components
             work on some browsers. It published in June 1999. CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called “modules”. 
             Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2
